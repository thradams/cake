<p>Last Updated 20 Nov 2024</p>

<p>This is a work in progress. Cake source is currently being used to validate the concepts. It&#39;s in the process of transitioning to include annotated nullable checks, which was the last feature added.  </p>

<h2 id="toc_0">Abstract</h2>

<p>The objective is to statically check code and prevent bugs, including memory bugs like double free, 
null dereference and memory leaks. New qualifiers have been created to extend the type system and 
insert information at function declarations.</p>

<p>Ultimately, we still have the same language, but with an improved type system that checks new contracts.
These new contracts can be ignored, the language <strong>and existing code patterns</strong> remains unmodified. </p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Concepts</h2>

<h3 id="toc_2">Nullable Pointers</h3>

<p>The qualifier <code>_Opt</code> explicitly indicates when a pointer is nullable, while the 
absence of the qualifier implies that a pointer is non-nullable. 
This qualifier applies exclusively to pointers and is placed after the <code>*</code> symbol, 
in the same manner as <code>const</code>.</p>

<p>For instance, the standard function <code>strdup</code> is can be declared as:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">char * _Opt strdup(const char * src);
</code></pre>

<p>This indicates that the result may be null, while the argument must point to a valid string.</p>

<p>Since the absence of the _Opt qualifier indicates that the pointer is non-null, 
it is necessary to explicitly indicate when this rule applies. 
This is managed through the #pragma nullable enable directive.</p>

<h4>Example 1: Warning for Non-Nullable Pointers</h4>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma nullable enable  
int main(){
  int * p = nullptr; // warning
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>In this example, a warning is generated because <code>p</code> is non-nullable, yet it is being assigned <code>nullptr</code>. </p>

<h4>Example 2: Converting Non-Nullable to Nullable</h4>

<p>The conversion from a non-nullable pointer to a nullable one is allowed, as shown below:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma nullable enable  
char * get_name();  
int main(){
  char * _Opt s = get_name(); 
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>Here, the return value of <code>get_name()</code> is non-nullable by default, but it is assigned to a nullable pointer <code>s</code>, which does not trigger any warnings.</p>

<h4>Example 3: Diagnostic for Nullable to Non-Nullable Conversion</h4>

<p>Consider the following case:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma nullable enable  
  
char * _Opt strdup(const char * src);  
 
void f(char *s);  

int main()
{  
   char * _Opt s1 = strdup(&quot;a&quot;);
   f(s1); // warning
} 
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>In this scenario, <code>s1</code> is declared as nullable, but <code>f</code> expects a non-nullable argument. This triggers a warning, as the nullable pointer <code>s1</code> could potentially be null when passed to <code>f</code>. To resolve this warning, a null check is required:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">  if (s1)
    f(s1); // ok
</code></pre>

<p>This warning relies on flow analysis, which ensures that the potential nullability of pointers is checked before being passed to functions or assigned to non-nullable variables.</p>

<h4>Non nullable members</h4>

<p>The concept of nullable types is present in some language like C# and Typescript.
Both languages have the concept of object constructor. For object members, the compiler checks if 
after the constructor the non-nullable members have being assigned to a non null value.</p>

<p>For instance, in Typescript</p>

<pre><code class="language-ts">class Y { 
  public i = 0; 
}

class X 
{ 
  public readonly i : number; 
  public pY : Y;  
  constructor(){
    //Property &#39;pY&#39; has no initializer and is not definitely assigned 
    //in the constructor.(2564)    
    //this.pY = new Y;
    //this.i = 1;
  }
}

</code></pre>

<p>The other way to see this, is that during construction the invariant of the object is not complete yet.</p>

<p>In C, we don t have the concept of constructor, so the same approach cannot be applied directly.</p>

<p>Cake, have a mechanism using the qualifier <code>_Opt</code> before struct types to make all non-nullable members as nullable for a particular instance.
This allow us the have a object where the invariant is not completed.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X {
  char * name; //non nullable
};  

struct X * _Opt makeX(const char* name)
{
  _Opt struct X * p = calloc(1, sizeof * p);  
  if (p == NULL) 
    return NULL;
  
  char * _Opt temp = strdup(name);
  if (temp == NULL)
    return NULL;  

  x-&gt;name = temp;    
  return x;
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>The particular instance of p, that has being qualified with _Opt, is allowed to have no-nullable members with a null values.</p>

<p>However, we cannot leave this function with a non-nullable member being null because the result of 
the function is not _Opt qualified.
This approach makes it possible to have an alternative design for constructors.</p>

<p>This state is also useful for some functions like destructor, to be able to destroy partially constructed objects.
For instance:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void x_destroy(_Opt struct X * p)
{
   free(p-&gt;name); //ok
}  
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Note : This design may change and be replaced by mutable.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>mutable</h4>

<p>Note that this concept of constructor phase also could be applied for const members. </p>

<p>The introduction of a <strong>mutable</strong> qualifier allows certain exceptions to the usual contract 
of immutability and non-nullability during transitional phases, such as in constructors and destructors. </p>

<p>This means that objects marked as <strong>mutable</strong> can temporarily violate their normal constraints, 
such as modifying <code>const</code> members or assigning null to non-nullable pointers during these phases.</p>

<p>Consider the following code example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X {
  const char * const name; // non-nullable
};  

struct X * _Opt makeX(const char* name)
{
  mutable struct X * p = calloc(1, sizeof *p);  
  if (p == NULL) 
    return NULL;
  
  char * _Opt temp = strdup(name);
  if (temp == NULL)
    return NULL;  

  p-&gt;name = temp;  // OK!!
  return p;
}
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, <code>struct X</code> has a <code>const</code> member <code>name</code>, which is non-nullable.
Under normal conditions, modifying a <code>const</code> member after initialization would be disallowed. </p>

<p>However, the <strong>mutable</strong> qualifier temporarily relaxes this rule during the object’s creation process,
allowing modifications even to <code>const</code> members, and allowing a non-nullable pointer to be null 
before the object’s initialization completes.</p>

<p>We also have an implicit contract for struct members. 
Generally, we assume that members are initialized, but we lack a qualifier to explicitly 
indicate &quot;initialized member.&quot; 
For instance, when using malloc, members are initially uninitialized, but they should receive a value before being used.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">struct X * _Opt makeX(const char* name)
{
  mutable struct X * p = malloc(sizeof *p);  
  if (p == NULL) 
    return NULL;
  
  char * _Opt temp = strdup(name);
  if (temp == NULL)
    return NULL;  

  p-&gt;name = temp;  // OK!! name fixed

  return p;
}
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>OBS: mutable qualifier is not yet implemented in Cake. However, _Opt for structs is implemented and may be replaced in the future</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="toc_3">Object lifetime checks</h3>

<p>From the C23 standard:</p>

<p>&quot;The <em>lifetime</em> of an object is the portion of program execution during which storage is guaranteed
to be reserved for it. An object exists, has a constant address, and retains its last-stored value
throughout its lifetime) If an object is referred to outside of its lifetime, the <strong>behavior is undefined</strong>&quot;</p>

<p>To conceptually manage the storage and object lifetime we will use the concept of ownership.</p>

<h4>Owner references</h4>

<p>An <strong>owner reference</strong> is an object referencing another object and managing its lifetime. </p>

<p>The most common type of owner reference are pointers to <em>allocated</em> objects.  We can call then just <strong>owner pointers</strong>.  </p>

<p><strong>Sample - Owner Pointer to FILE</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    FILE *_Owner _Opt f = fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
    if (f)
    {
       fclose(f);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<h5>#pragma ownership enabled</h5>

<p>Object lifetime checks are enabled with the <code>#pragma ownership enable</code>.<br>
Qualifiers like <code>_Owner</code> can be used when ownership is disabled but they are ignored.</p>

<h5>#pragma safety enabled</h5>

<p><code>#pragma safety enable</code> is equivalent of :</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma nullable enable
#pragma ownership enable
</code></pre>

<p>Sample:  </p>

<p>If the programmer incorrectly assumes that <code>fclose</code> accepts NULL.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    FILE * _Owner _Opt f = fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
    if (f)
    {
    }
    //warning: assignment of possible null object &#39;p&#39; to non-opt pointer [-Wnullable-to-non-nullable]
    fclose(f);
}    
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> An <strong>owner reference</strong> is always the unique owner of the referenced object. As a consequence when owner references are copied the ownership is transferred.</p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Before the end of its lifetime, owner references must move the ownership of the objects they own.</p>

<p>The cake ownership model does not have the concept of a destroyed object. Instead, everything is viewed as a transformation, where the object is broken into 
smaller parts and those parts are moved.</p>

<p>Sample</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main()
{
    FILE * _Owner _Opt f = fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
    FILE * _Owner _Opt f2 = f; /*MOVED*/
    if (f2)
       fclose(f2); /*MOVED*/
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>Invoking a function <code>fclose</code> is analogous to assignment of the argument <code>f2</code>, resulting in the transfer of ownership of <code>f2</code> to the function parameter.  </p>

<p>Sample - Declaration of fopen and fclose</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">FILE * _Owner _Opt fopen( const char *filename, const char *mode );
void fclose(FILE * _Owner p); /*p is not nullable*/
</code></pre>

<h4>Non-pointer owner references</h4>

<p>We can have other types of <strong>owner references</strong>.   </p>

<p>For instance, Berkeley sockets use an integer to identify the socket.</p>

<p>Sample</p>

<pre><code class="language-c"> _Owner int server_socket = socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
 /*...*/
 close(server_socket);
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: The location and usage of the qualifier _Owner is similar to the const qualifier. For pointers, it goes after *, and for this socket sample, it can be before int. The _Owner qualifier belongs to the object (memory)that holds the reference.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When a struct or union have at least one owner object we can say the struct is a owner object too.</p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Owner objects cannot be discarded.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main() {  
  fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;); //warning   
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> A non-owner object cannot be copied to a owner object.</p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> The null pointer constant can be used to initialize owner objects.</p>

<p><strong>Sample</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

typedef int T;
  
T * f(); /*returning non owner*/  

int main() {  
   T * _Owner p = f();      //ERROR   
   T * _Owner _Opt _p2 = 0; //OK
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<h4>View references</h4>

<p>A <strong>view reference</strong> is an object referencing another object without managing its lifetime. </p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> The lifetime of the referenced object must be longer than the lifetime of the view reference.</p>

<p>Sample:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

struct X
{
    int i;
}
int main(){

  struct X * _Opt p = nullptr;
  {
    struct X x = {};
    p = &amp;x;
  }
  p-&gt;i = 1; //warning
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>The most common view references are pointers called <strong>view pointers</strong>. </p>

<p>The view qualifier is not necessary for pointers, since it&#39;s the default behavior. The usage of _View in pointers  are forbidden to avoid the propagation of more than one style.  </p>

<p>When an owner object is copied to a view object, the ownership is not transferred.</p>

<p><strong>Sample</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void use_file(FILE * f) {}

int main() {
    FILE * _Owner _Opt f = fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
    if (f) {
        use_file(f); //not moved
        fclose(f);
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>When a <strong>_View</strong> qualifier is used in structs, it makes all members as view objects. </p>

<p><strong>Sample - A view parameter</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X {   
  char * _Owner _Opt text;   
};  

void f(_View struct X x) { /*...*/ }  

int main() {
    struct X x = {};
    f(x); /*NOT MOVED*/    
    free(x.text);
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: It is interesting to compare against const qualifier. While const adds a qualifier &quot;const&quot; &quot;_View&quot; removes the qualifier &quot;_Owner&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4>Returning a pointer to a view object</h4>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> We cannot return a view pointer to objects with automatic storage duration from the function scope.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

int * f()
{
   int a = 1;
   return &amp;a; //ERROR
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>But we can return a view pointer to objects with static, thread and allocated duration.</p>

<p>Sample:
<code>c
static int a = 1;
int * f()
{   
   return &amp;a; // OK
}  
</code>  </p>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>We can return view pointers to objects pointed by parameters because they are from one scope above.  We cannot return the address of the parameters.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">int * f2(int *p) {
   return p; //OK
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>Now consider:</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int * max(int * p1, int * p2) {  
 return *p1 &gt; *p2 ? p1 : p2;
}

int main(){  
   int * p = NULL;
   int a  = 1;
   {
      int b = 2;
      p = max(&amp;a,  &amp;b);
   }
   printf(&quot;%d&quot;, *p);
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>Examining the implementation reveals that the returned view pointer&#39;s lifetime can be that of either &#39;a&#39; or &#39;b&#39;.</p>

<p>This check is missing at cake but the idea is to make <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> suspects. Considering the lifetime of <code>b</code> smaller than <code>p</code> then the programmer needs to tell the compiler that <code>p</code> cannot be <code>b</code>. For instance <code>assert(p != &amp;b);</code>.<br>
But the programmer will not do that in this code. The expectation is that code naturally will avoid this kind of situation using the returned object in a limited scope.
When objects with static storage duration are returned we don&#39;t need to check suspects as well.  This is not implemented yet but one alternative is to use <code>char * static</code> to inform <em>&quot;pointer to static storage duration object&quot;</em>.</p>

<h4>Deleting Owner Pointers</h4>

<p><strong>Owner pointers</strong> take on the responsibility of owning the pointed object and its associated storage, treating them as distinct entities.</p>

<p>A common practice is to implement a delete function to release both resources.</p>

<p><strong>Sample - Implementing the delete function</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X {
  char * _Owner text; 
};

void x_destroy(_Opt struct X * _Obj_owner x) { 
  free(x-&gt;text); 
}

void x_delete(_Opt struct X * _Owner _Opt p) { 
  if (p) {
    x_destroy(p); /* *p is moved*/
    free(p);
  }
}

int main() {
   _Opt struct X * _Owner _Opt pX = calloc(1, sizeof * pX);
   if (pX) {
     /*...*/;
     x_delete( pX); 
   }
 } 

</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>The differentiation of object and storage ownership is given by the <code>void *</code> conversion.  Moving <code>void*</code> implies that only the storage without any object on it is being moved.</p>

<h4>Conversion from <code>T * _Owner</code> to <code>void * _Owner</code></h4>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Assignment or cast from <code>T * _Owner</code> to <code>void * _Owner</code> requires the pointed object T to be empty.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

struct X {
    char * _Owner text;
};

struct X * _Owner make();

int main(){
   void * _Owner _Opt p = nullptr;
   struct X * _Owner pX = make();
   p = pX; //warning
}

</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>When the object is created on the stack, we can implement a destructor.</p>

<p><strong>Sample - Implementing a destructor</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X {
    char * _Owner _Opt text;
};  

void x_destroy(struct X x) {
    free(x.text);
}  

int main() {
    struct X x = {};
    /*...*/
    x_destroy(x); /*x is moved*/
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>However in C, structs are typically passed by pointer rather than by value. To transfer the ownership of an owner object to a pointer, Cake introduces a new qualifier, <strong>_Obj_owner</strong>. </p>

<p>It can also be seen as an owner pointer that owns the object but not the storage. (Better names?)</p>

<p>A pointer qualified with <strong>_Obj_owner</strong> is the owner of the pointed object but not responsible for managing its memory.</p>

<p>The next sample illustrates how to implement a destructor using a _Obj_owner pointer parameter.</p>

<p><strong>Sample - Implementing a destructor using _Obj_owner</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X {
    char * _Owner _Opt text;
};

void x_destroy(_Opt struct X * _Obj_owner x) {
    free(x-&gt;text);
    /*x is not the owner of the memory*/
}

int main() {
    struct X x = {};
    /*more code*/
    x_destroy(&amp;x); /*x is moved*/
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>In order to prevent moving from a non owner object, only <em>address of expressions</em> to <strong>_Obj_owner</strong> are allowed. </p>

<p><strong>Sample - Non address of expression or owner pointer.</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X {
 struct Y * p;
};

void y_destroy(struct Y * _Obj_owner p);

void f(struct X * x) {
  //Error: parameter 1 requires a pointer to owner object
  //Error: pointed object is not owner
  y_destroy(x-&gt;p); 
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>We can copy an <strong>owner</strong> pointer to an <strong>_Obj_owner</strong> pointer. In this scenario, only the ownership of the pointed object is transferred, not the memory ownership.   </p>

<p><strong>Sample - Using <code>x_destroy</code> to implement <code>x_delete</code></strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X {
  char * _Owner text; 
};

void x_destroy(_Opt struct X * _Obj_owner x) { 
  free(x-&gt;text); 
}

void x_delete(_Opt struct X * _Owner _Opt p) { 
  if (p) {
    x_destroy(p); /* *p is moved*/
    free(p);
  }
}

int main() {
   struct X * _Opt _Owner pX = calloc(1, sizeof * pX);
   if (pX) {
     /*...*/;
     x_delete(pX); 
   }
 } 

</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>In C, array types in arguments are pointers. This characteristics is preserved.</p>

<p>To use owner qualifier in array we do. (Just like const)</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

void free(void * _Owner _Opt p);

void f(int a[_Owner])
{
  free(a);
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>But I think this is quite uncommon.</p>

<h2 id="toc_4">Flow analysis</h2>

<p>Flow analysis is the core feature that enables the nullable and lifetime checks.</p>

<p>The compiler flag <code>-fanalyzer</code> activates the flow analysis that works a secondary pass.</p>

<p>Flow analysis  also can be enabled/disable with pragma</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma flow enable
</code></pre>

<p>When pragma safety, nullable or ownership are enabled, they enable flow as well.</p>

<p>To check the nullable and ownership rules, the compiler use these states:</p>

<ul>
<li>nothing</li>
<li>uninitialized</li>
<li>moved</li>
<li>null</li>
<li>not-null</li>
<li>zero</li>
<li>not-zero</li>
<li>lifetime-ended</li>
</ul>

<p>We can print these states using the <strong>static_debug</strong> declaration.
We can also assert the variable is at a certain state using the <strong>static_state</strong> declaration. </p>

<p><strong>Sample - Usage of static_state and static_debug</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

int main() {
  int a;   
  static_state(a, &quot;uninitialized&quot;); //checks a state  
  static_debug(a);                  //prints &#39;a&#39; state 
}
</code></pre>

<h4>Uninitialized state</h4>

<p>The <strong>uninitialized</strong> state is the state of local variables that are declared but not initialized. </p>

<p>Objects are defined as having both a real part and an imaginary one. The real part corresponds to the actual value stored in memory, while the imaginary part lacks any physical representation. Consequently, the uninitialized state refers to this imaginary part, leaving the real value unspecified.</p>

<p>Flow analysis must  ensure that we don&#39;t read uninitialized objects.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

int printf(const char* restrict format, ...);

void f(int condition) {
   int i;
   if (condition) 
    i = 0;
   printf(&quot;%d&quot;, i); //warning i may be uninitialized
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>The other situation were variables becomes `<strong>uninitialized</strong> is when moving ownership to function parameters. </p>

<p>This prevents bugs like double free or use after free.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

int * _Owner f();
void free(void * _Owner _Opt p);

int main() {   
   int * _Owner p = f();
   free(p);
   free(p); //warning p is uninitialized
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<h4>Moved state</h4>

<p>The <strong>moved</strong> state is similar to the <em>uninitialized</em> state, it is also an imaginary state and does not have a representation on storage.  </p>

<p>The difference is that the moved state is used when moving local variables. For pointers, the moved state implies that the pointer was not-null. </p>

<p><strong>Sample - local scope moves</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

int * _Owner f();
void free(void * _Owner _Opt p);

int main() {   
   int * _Owner p = f();
   int * _Owner _Opt p2 = 0;
   p2 = p; // p moved to p2  
  
   //compiler knows that *p still valid  

   free(p); //warning p was moved

   free(p2); //ok
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<h4>_Out qualifier</h4>

<p>A common scenario where uninitialized objects are utilized is when a pointer to an uninitialized object is passed to an &quot;init&quot; function.</p>

<p>This situation is addressed by the qualifier <strong>_Out</strong>.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

struct X {
  char * _Owner _Opt text;
};

int init(_Out struct X *p)
{
  p-&gt;text = strdup(&quot;a&quot;); //safe
}

int main() {   
  struct X x;
  init(&amp;x);  
  free(x.text);
}  

</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>With the _Out qualifier, caller is informed that the argument must be uninitialized.</p>

<p>The implementation is aware that it can safely override the contents of the object <code>p-&gt;text</code> without causing a memory leak.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: There is no explicit &quot;initialized&quot; state. When referring to initialized objects, it means the state is neither &quot;moved&quot; nor &quot;uninitialized.&quot;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> All objects passed as arguments must be initialized and all objects reachable must be initialized.</p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> By default, the parameters of a function are considered initialized. The exception is created with _Out qualifier.</p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> We cannot pass initialized objects, or reachable initialized objects to <strong>_Out</strong> qualified object.</p>

<p>For instance, at set implementation we need free text before assignment.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
#include &lt;string.h&gt;

struct X {
  char * _Owner _Opt text;
};

int init(_Out struct X *p, const char * text)
{
   p-&gt;text = strdup(text); //safe
}

int set(struct X *p, const char * text)
{
  free(p-&gt;text); //necessary
  p-&gt;text = strdup(text);
}

int main() {   
  struct X x;
  init(&amp;x, &quot;text1&quot;);
  set(&amp;x, &quot;text2&quot;);   
  free(x.text);
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Function never returns uninitialized objects or reachable uninitialized objects.</p>

<p>TODO void objects.</p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Non owner objects accessible with parameters cannot leave scope with uninitialized/moved objects.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X {
  char * _Owner _Opt_ name;
};

void x_destroy(struct X * _Obj_owner p) {
  free(p-&gt;name); 
}

struct Y {
   struct X x;
}

void f(struct Y * p) {   
   x_destroy(&amp;p-&gt;x); //breaking the rule
}
  
int main() {
   struct Y  y = {};
   y.x.name = strdup(&quot;a&quot;);
   f(&amp;y);
   free(y.x.name);
}  

</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>Sample of swap if fine because at end of scopes objects are not uninitialized/moved.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct X
{
  char * _Owner name;
};

void x_destroy(struct X * _Obj_owner p)
{
  free(p-&gt;name); 
}

void x_swap(struct X * a, struct X * b) {
  struct X temp = *a;
  *a = *b;
  *b = temp;
} //ok
  
int main() {
   struct X x1 = {};
   struct X x2 = {};
  
   x_swap(&amp;x1, &amp;x2);
  
   x_destroy(&amp;x1);
   x_destroy(&amp;x2);
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<h4>Null and Not-Null state</h4>

<p>The <strong>null</strong> state means that pointers/objects are empty, In other words, not referencing any object. </p>

<p><strong>Sample - Null state</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

int main() {
 void * _Owner _Opt p = nullptr;   
 static_state(p, &quot;null&quot;); 
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p><strong>Rule:</strong> Before assignment, owner objects, must be empty or uninitialized.
The state must be null or uninitialized/moved.</p>

<p>Sample</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main() {
  FILE * _Owner _Opt file = fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;);
  file = fopen(&quot;file.txt&quot;, &quot;r&quot;); //warning
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>The <strong>not-null</strong> state indicates that the object is initialized and referencing an object.</p>

<p>The final state is combination of possibilities like <strong>null</strong> and <strong>not-null</strong>. 
We can check possible combinations using &quot;|&quot; at <code>static_state</code>.  </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

int main()
{
   void * _Owner p = malloc(1);
   if (p) {
     static_state(p, &quot;not-null&quot;);
   }      
   static_state(p, &quot;null | not-null&quot;);
   free(p);
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<h4>Zero and Not-Zero state</h4>

<p>The <strong>zero</strong> state is used for non-pointer objects to complement and support uninitialized checks.</p>

<p><strong>Sample - The zero state</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c">int main()
{
   int i = 0;
   static_state(i, &quot;zero&quot;);   
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p><strong>Zero</strong> and <strong>null</strong> are different states.
This difference is necessary because, for non-pointers like the socket sample, 
0 does not necessarily means null. 
The compiler does not know the semantics for types that are not pointers.</p>

<h4>lifetime-ended state</h4>

<p>This is the state when variables leave the scope or when objects are moved.</p>

<h4>static_set</h4>

<p>We can use <strong>static_set</strong> to override states.
In the next sample, we annotate that server_socket is null, which doesn&#39;t mean it 
is zero but indicates that it is not holding any resources and 
is safe to return without calling close.</p>

<p><strong>Sample - Usage of static_set</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c">  _Owner int server_socket =
     socket(AF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
  if (server_socket &lt; 0) {  
     static_set(server_socket, &quot;null&quot;);
     return;
  }  
 /*...*/
 close(server_socket);
</code></pre>

<p>The <strong>not-zero</strong> state is used in non-pointers objects to indicate the value is not zero.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">int f();

int main() {   
    int i = f();
    static_state(i, &quot;zero | not-zero&quot;);
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<p>Now let&#39;s consider <code>realloc</code> function.</p>

<pre><code class="language-c">void * _Owner _Opt _realloc( void * _Opt ptr, size_t new_size );    
</code></pre>

<p>In the declaration of <code>realloc</code>, we are not moving the ptr. The reason for that is because the <code>ptr</code> may or may not be moved. If the function returns NULL, <code>ptr</code> was not moved. </p>

<p><strong>Sample - Using static_set with realloc</strong></p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

void* _Owner _Opt malloc(size_t size);
void* _Owner _Opt realloc(void* _Opt ptr, size_t size);

int main()
{
  void * _Owner _Opt p = malloc(1);
  void * _Owner _Opt p2 = realloc(p, 2);
  if (p2 != 0)
  {
     // if p2 != 0 it  means p was moved
     static_set(p, &quot;moved&quot;);
     p = p2;
  }    
  free(p);
}

<h3 id="toc_5">assert is a built-in function</h3>

<p>Consider the following sample where we have a linked list. 
Each node has owner pointer to next. 
The next pointer of the tail of the list is always pointing to null, unless we have a bug. But the compiler does not know <code>list-&gt;tail-&gt;next</code> is null. Using assert we give this inform to the compiler and we also have a runtime check for possible logic bugs.</p>

<p><strong>Listing 22 shows the usage of assert.</strong> </p>

<pre><code class="language-c">#pragma safety enable

#include &lt;string.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;

struct node {
 char * _Owner text;
 struct node* _Owner next;
};

struct list {
  struct node * _Owner head;
  struct node * tail;
};

void list_append(struct list* list, struct node* _Owner node)
{
  if (list-&gt;head == NULL) 
  {
     list-&gt;head = node;
  }
  else
  {      

     //list-&gt;tail is not null. (becuase it is only null if head is also null)
     assert(list-&gt;tail != 0);         

     //next is always null becuase it is the last node
     assert(list-&gt;tail-&gt;next == 0);

     list-&gt;tail-&gt;next = node;
   }
   list-&gt;tail = node;
}
</code></pre>

<p><button onclick="Try(this)">try</button></p>

<h2 id="toc_6">Code transition Strategy</h2>

<p>If the compiler supports ownership checks it must define  <code>__STDC_OWNERSHIP__</code>. </p>

<p>If the compiler supports nullable types it must define  <code>__STDC_NULLABLE__</code>. </p>

<p>If the compiler supports flow analysis it must define  <code>__STDC_FLOW__</code>. </p>

<h4>undefined behavior (From C23)</h4>

<p>behavior, upon use of a nonportable or erroneous program construct or of erroneous data, for which
this document imposes no requirements
2 Note 1 to entry: Possible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the situation completely with unpredictable results,
to behaving during translation or program execution in a documented manner characteristic of the environment (with or
without the issuance of a diagnostic message), to terminating a translation or execution (with the issuance of a diagnostic
message).</p>

<h4>indeterminate representation (From C23)</h4>

<p>object representation that either represents an unspecified value or is a non-value representation  </p>

<h4>unspecified value (From C23)</h4>

<p>valid value of the relevant type where this document imposes no requirements on which value is  </p>

<h4>unspecified behavior (From C23)</h4>

<p>behavior, that results from the use of an unspecified value, or other behavior upon which this
document provides two or more possibilities and imposes no further requirements on which is
chosen in any instance</p>

<h4>lifetime (From C23)</h4>

<p>The lifetime of an object is the portion of program execution during which storage is guaranteed
to be reserved for it. An object exists, has a constant address36), and retains its last-stored value
throughout its lifetime37) If an object is referred to outside of its lifetime, the behavior is undefined.
If a pointer value is used in an evaluation after the object the pointer points to (or just past) reaches
the end of its lifetime, the behavior is undefined. The representation of a pointer object becomes
indeterminate when the object the pointer points to (or just past) reaches the end of its lifetime</p>

<h4>object (From C23)</h4>

<p>region of data storage in the execution environment, the contents of which can represent values</p>
